<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The classic game of Pig! The goal is to be the first person to get to 100 points. In order to get points you must roll a 6-sided die. You can roll as many times as you like and the results of these rolls will accumulate in your current pool, but be careful because if you roll a 1, you lose the entire pool and your opponent gets their turn! That's alright though because you have the option to hold your pool and add them to your total points, however, you will still have to pass the turn to your opponent. It's a game of risk vs. reward. Will you hoard points aggressively to close the game out quickly but risk setting yourself back farther? Or will you take a slow but consistent path to victory?
